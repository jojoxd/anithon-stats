# Anithon Stats Project

This project is for generating a complete, chunked list of Anime, for use in an Anithon (Anime Marathon).

This code is very much alive, and as such, will change and break often.
This is also why there will never be a finished release.

Notable files are `ChunkService.ts` and `EntryService.ts`

## Running this project

`yarn start` and `cd frontend && yarn dev`
